# Regional Growth in the EU-15 countries

## Description: 

First, I employ a clustering algorithm to show natural grouping of NUTS-2 level regions with respect to their GDP per capita growth. 
The ML algorithm enables different paths for transition, for example different technology growth rates or convergence speeds are made possible. 
Secondly, I investigate spatial autocorrelation among regions. For this global and local Moran's I methodology captures interdependencies and co-movements of regional growth based on location. 

## Objective: 

It is to understand why some regions are richer and others are less so in the long-run perspective. Testing whether capitals and borders matter 
quantitatively when determining the regions' income performances.
