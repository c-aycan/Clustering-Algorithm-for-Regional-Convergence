# Regional Growth in the EU-15 countries

## Description: 

First, I employ a clustering algorithm to show natural grouping of NUTS-2 level regions with respect to their GDP per capita growth. 
Secondly, I investigate spatial autocorrelation among regions. The ML algorithm enables different paths for transition, for example different technology 
growth rates or convergence speeds are made possible. While global and local Moran's I methodology captures interdependencies and co-movement of regional 
growth based on their location. 

## Objective: 

It is to understand why some regions are richer and others are less so in the long-run perspective. Testing whether capitals and borders matter 
quantitatively when determining the regions' income performances.
